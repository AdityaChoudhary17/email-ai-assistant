üöÄ Project Title & Tagline
===========================
**Email AI Assistant** üìß
"Revolutionizing Email Management with Artificial Intelligence" ü§ñ

üìñ Description
---------------
The Email AI Assistant is a cutting-edge project that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to simplify and automate email management tasks. This innovative tool utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze and extract valuable information from emails, making it easier for users to stay organized and focused on high-priority tasks. With its user-friendly interface and robust feature set, the Email AI Assistant is poised to transform the way we interact with emails.

The project consists of two primary components: `email_ai_assistant.py` and `Second_ai_Assistant.py`. The `email_ai_assistant.py` file serves as the main entry point, utilizing popular libraries such as `pandas`, `re`, `streamlit`, and `transformers` to provide a comprehensive email analysis platform. The `Second_ai_Assistant.py` file, on the other hand, focuses on extracting contact information from emails using regular expressions and NLP techniques.

The Email AI Assistant is designed to cater to the needs of individuals and organizations seeking to streamline their email management processes. By automating tasks such as email categorization, contact information extraction, and content analysis, this project aims to reduce the time and effort required to manage emails, allowing users to focus on more critical aspects of their work or personal lives.
